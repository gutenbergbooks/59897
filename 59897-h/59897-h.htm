TO SHAKESPEARE, IN 1916<BR>
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
With what white wrath must turn thy bones,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">What stern amazement flame thy dust,</SPAN><BR>
To feel so near this England's heart<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">The outrage of the assassin's thrust!</SPAN><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
How must thou burn to have endured<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">The acclaim of these whose fame unclean</SPAN><BR>
Reeks from the "Lusitania's" slain,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Stinks from the orgies of Malines!</SPAN><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
But surely, too, thou art consoled<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">(Who knew'st thy stalwart breed so well)</SPAN><BR>
To see us rise from sloth, and go,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Plain and unbragging, through this hell.</SPAN><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
And surely, too, thou art assured.<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Hark how that grim and gathering beat</SPAN><BR>
Draws upwards from the ends of earth,&mdash;<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">The tramp, tramp, of thy kinsmen's feet.</SPAN><BR>

  "THE UNKNOWN CITY"
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
There lies a city inaccessible,<BR>
Where the dead dreamers dwell.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Abrupt and blue, with many a high ravine<BR>
And soaring bridge half seen.<BR>
With many an iris cloud that comes and goes<BR>
Over the ancient snows,<BR>
The imminent hills environ it, and hold<BR>
Its portals from of old,<BR>
That grief invade not, weariness, nor war,<BR>
Nor anguish evermore.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
White-walled and jettied on the peacock tide,<BR>
With domes and towers enskied,<BR>
Its battlements and balconies one sheen<BR>
Of ever-living green,<BR>
It hears the happy dreamers turning home<BR>
Slow-oared across the foam.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Cool are its streets with waters musical<BR>
And fountains' shadowy fall.<BR>
With orange and anemone and rose,<BR>
And every flower that blows<BR>
Of magic scent or unimagined dye,<BR>
Its gardens shine and sigh.<BR>
Its chambers, memoried with old romance<BR>
And faëry circumstance,&mdash;<BR>
From any window love may lean some time<BR>
For love that dares to climb.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
This is that city babe and seer divined<BR>
With pure, believing mind.<BR>
This is the home of unachieved emprize.<BR>
Here, here the visioned eyes<BR>
Of them that dream past any power to do,<BR>
Wake to the dream come true.<BR>
Here the high failure, not the level fame,<BR>
Attests the spirit's aim.<BR>
Here is fulfilled each hope that soared and sought<BR>
Beyond the bournes of thought.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
The obdurate marble yields; the canvas glows;<BR>
Perfect the column grows;<BR>
The chorded cadence art could ne'er attain<BR>
Crowns the imperfect strain;<BR>
And the great song that seemed to die unsung<BR>
Triumphs upon the tongue.<BR>

  O EARTH, SUFFICING ALL OUR NEEDS
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
O earth, sufficing all our needs, O you<BR>
With room for body and for spirit too,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">How patient while your children vex their souls</SPAN><BR>
Devising alien heavens beyond your blue!<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Dear dwelling of the immortal and unseen,<BR>
How obstinate in my blindness have I been,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Not comprehending what your tender calls,</SPAN><BR>
Veiled promises and re-assurance, mean.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Not far and cold the way that they have gone<BR>
Who through your sundering darkness have withdrawn;<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Almost within our hand-reach they remain</SPAN><BR>
Who pass beyond the sequence of the dawn.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Not far and strange the Heaven, but very near,<BR>
Your children's hearts unknowingly hold dear.<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">At times we almost catch the door swung wide.</SPAN><BR>
And unforgotten voice almost we hear,<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
I am the heir of Heaven&mdash;and you are just.<BR>
You, you alone I know&mdash;and you I trust.<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">I have sought God beyond his farthest star&mdash;</SPAN><BR>
But here I find Him, in your quickening dust.<BR>

  MONITION
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
A faint wind, blowing from World's End,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Made strange the city street.</SPAN><BR>
A strange sound mingled in the fall<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Of the familiar feet.</SPAN><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Something unseen whirled with the leaves<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">To tap on door and sill.</SPAN><BR>
Something unknown went whispering by<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Even when the wind was still.</SPAN><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
And men looked up with startled eyes<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">And hurried on their way,</SPAN><BR>
As if they had been called, and told<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">How brief their day.</SPAN><BR>

  ON THE ROAD
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
Ever just over the top of the next brown rise<BR>
I expect some wonderful thing to flatter my eyes.<BR>
"What's yonder?" I ask of the first wayfarer I meet.<BR>
"Nothing!" he answers, and looks at my travel-worn feet.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
"Only more hills and more hills, like the many you've passed,<BR>
With rough country between, and a poor enough inn at the last."<BR>
But already I am a-move, for I see he is blind,<BR>
And I hate that old grumble I've listened to time out of mind.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
I've tramped it too long not to know there is truth in it still,<BR>
That lure of the turn of the road, of the crest of the hill.<BR>
So I breast me the rise with full hope, well assured I shall see<BR>
Some new prospect of joy, some brave venture a tip-toe for me.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
For I have come far, and confronted the calm and the strife.<BR>
I have fared wide, and bit deep in the apple of life.<BR>
It is sweet at the rind, but oh, sweeter still at the core;<BR>
And whatever be gained, yet the reach of the morrow is more.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
At the crest of the hill I shall hail the new summits to climb.<BR>
The demand of my vision shall beggar the largess of time.<BR>
For I know that the higher I press, the wider I view,<BR>
The more's to be ventured and visioned, in worlds that are new.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
So when my feet, failing, shall stumble in ultimate dark,<BR>
And faint eyes no more the high lift of the pathway shall mark,<BR>
There under the dew I'll lie down with my dreams, for I know<BR>
What bright hill-tops the morning will show me, all red in the glow.<BR>

I<BR>
</H4>

<P CLASS="poem">
Here on the hill<BR>
At last the soul sees clear.<BR>
Desire being still<BR>
The High Unseen appear.<BR>
The thin grass bends<BR>
One way, and hushed attends<BR>
Unknown and gracious ends.<BR>
Where the sheep's pasturing feet<BR>
Have cleft the sods<BR>
The mystic light lies sweet;<BR>
The very clods,<BR>
In purpling hues elate,<BR>
Thrill to their fate;<BR>
The high rock-hollows wait,<BR>
Expecting gods.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
When the lights come out in the cottages<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Along the shores at eve,</SPAN><BR>
And across the darkening water<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">The last pale shadows leave;</SPAN><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
And up from the rock-ridged pasture slopes<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">The sheep-bell tinklings steal,</SPAN><BR>
And the folds are shut, and the shepherds<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Turn to their quiet meal;</SPAN><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
And even here, on the unfenced height,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">No journeying wind goes by,</SPAN><BR>
But the earth-sweet smells, and the home-sweet sounds,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Mount, like prayer, to the sky;</SPAN><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Then from the door of my opened heart<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Old blindness and pride are driven,</SPAN><BR>
Till I know how high is the humble,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">The dear earth how close to heaven.</SPAN><BR>

  IN THE VALLEY OF LUCHON
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
Day long, and night long,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">From the soaring peaks and the snow,</SPAN><BR>
Down through the valley villages<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">The cold white waters flow.</SPAN><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Quiet are the villages;<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">And very quiet the cloud</SPAN><BR>
At rest on the breast of the mountain;<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">But the falling waves are loud</SPAN><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Through the little, clustering cottages,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Through the little, climbing fields,</SPAN><BR>
Where every sunburnt vineyard<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Its patch of purple yields.</SPAN><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
High hung, a steel-bright scimitar,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">The crooked glacier gleams.</SPAN><BR>
The white church dreams in the valley<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Where the red oleander dreams.</SPAN><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
And every wonder of beauty<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Comes, as a dream comes, true,</SPAN><BR>
Where the sun drips rose from the ledges<BR>

A presence in the wood,<BR>

Turning to seek your smile<BR>
For solace or for joy.<BR>

Nor is it in the dark,<BR>
When I toss restlessly,<BR>
Groping to find your face,<BR>
Half waking, half in dream.<BR>

It is not while I work,&mdash;<BR>
When, to endear success,<BR>
Or rob defeat of pain,<BR>
I weary for your hands.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
Nor while from work I rest,<BR>
And rest is all unrest<BR>
For lack of your dear voice,<BR>
Your laughter, and your lips.<BR>

But every hour it is<BR>
That I desire you most,&mdash;<BR>
Need you in all my life<BR>
And every breath I breathe.<BR>

I am the man who found a flower,<BR>

More radiant than the sunrise rose,<BR>

I clutched the flower, and on my heart<BR>

Singing it goes<BR>

Beneath the basking noon,<BR>

Awakes the dreaming shade.<BR>

  CAMBRAI AND MARNE

<P CLASS="poem">
Before our trenches at Cambrai<BR>
We saw their columns cringe away.<BR>
We saw their masses melt and reel<BR>
Before our line of leaping steel.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
A handful to their storming hordes<BR>
We scourged them with the scourge of swords,<BR>
And still, the more we slew, the more<BR>

Between the hedges and the town<BR>
Their cursing squadrons we rode down.<BR>
To stay them we outpoured our blood<BR>
Between the beetfields and the wood.<BR>

In that red hell of shrieking shell<BR>
Unfaltering our gunners fell.<BR>
They fell, or ere that day was done,<BR>
Beside the last unshattered gun.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
But still we held them, like a wall<BR>
On which the breakers vainly fall&mdash;<BR>
Till came the word, and we obeyed,<BR>
Reluctant, bleeding, undismayed.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
Our feet, astonished, learned retreat,<BR>
Our souls rejected still defeat.<BR>
Unbroken still, a lion at bay,<BR>
We drew back grimly from Cambrai.<BR>

In blood and sweat, with slaughter spent,<BR>
They thought us beaten as we went;<BR>
Till suddenly we turned and smote<BR>
The shout of triumph in their throat.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
At last, at last we turned and stood&mdash;<BR>
And Marne's fair water ran with blood.<BR>
We stood by trench and steel and gun,<BR>
For now the indignant flight was done.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
We ploughed their shaken ranks with fire.<BR>
We trod their masses into mire.<BR>
Our sabres drove through their retreat,<BR>
As drives the whirlwind through young wheat.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
At last, at last we flung them back<BR>
Along their drenched and smoking track.<BR>
We hurled them back, in blood and flame,<BR>
The reeking ways by which they came.<BR>

By cumbered road and desperate ford,<BR>
How fled their shamed and harassed horde!<BR>
Shout, Sons of Freemen, for the day<BR>

be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any

copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
