TO SHAKESPEARE, IN 1916<BR>
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
With what white wrath must turn thy bones,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">What stern amazement flame thy dust,</SPAN><BR>
To feel so near this England's heart<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">The outrage of the assassin's thrust!</SPAN><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
How must thou burn to have endured<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">The acclaim of these whose fame unclean</SPAN><BR>
Reeks from the "Lusitania's" slain,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Stinks from the orgies of Malines!</SPAN><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
But surely, too, thou art consoled<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">(Who knew'st thy stalwart breed so well)</SPAN><BR>
To see us rise from sloth, and go,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Plain and unbragging, through this hell.</SPAN><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
And surely, too, thou art assured.<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Hark how that grim and gathering beat</SPAN><BR>
Draws upwards from the ends of earth,&mdash;<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">The tramp, tramp, of thy kinsmen's feet.</SPAN><BR>

  "THE UNKNOWN CITY"
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
There lies a city inaccessible,<BR>
Where the dead dreamers dwell.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Abrupt and blue, with many a high ravine<BR>
And soaring bridge half seen.<BR>
With many an iris cloud that comes and goes<BR>
Over the ancient snows,<BR>
The imminent hills environ it, and hold<BR>
Its portals from of old,<BR>
That grief invade not, weariness, nor war,<BR>
Nor anguish evermore.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
White-walled and jettied on the peacock tide,<BR>
With domes and towers enskied,<BR>
Its battlements and balconies one sheen<BR>
Of ever-living green,<BR>
It hears the happy dreamers turning home<BR>
Slow-oared across the foam.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Cool are its streets with waters musical<BR>
And fountains' shadowy fall.<BR>
With orange and anemone and rose,<BR>
And every flower that blows<BR>
Of magic scent or unimagined dye,<BR>
Its gardens shine and sigh.<BR>
Its chambers, memoried with old romance<BR>
And faëry circumstance,&mdash;<BR>
From any window love may lean some time<BR>
For love that dares to climb.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
This is that city babe and seer divined<BR>
With pure, believing mind.<BR>
This is the home of unachieved emprize.<BR>
Here, here the visioned eyes<BR>
Of them that dream past any power to do,<BR>
Wake to the dream come true.<BR>
Here the high failure, not the level fame,<BR>
Attests the spirit's aim.<BR>
Here is fulfilled each hope that soared and sought<BR>
Beyond the bournes of thought.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
The obdurate marble yields; the canvas glows;<BR>
Perfect the column grows;<BR>
The chorded cadence art could ne'er attain<BR>
Crowns the imperfect strain;<BR>
And the great song that seemed to die unsung<BR>
Triumphs upon the tongue.<BR>
</P>

  O EARTH, SUFFICING ALL OUR NEEDS
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
O earth, sufficing all our needs, O you<BR>
With room for body and for spirit too,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">How patient while your children vex their souls</SPAN><BR>
Devising alien heavens beyond your blue!<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Dear dwelling of the immortal and unseen,<BR>
How obstinate in my blindness have I been,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Not comprehending what your tender calls,</SPAN><BR>
Veiled promises and re-assurance, mean.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Not far and cold the way that they have gone<BR>
Who through your sundering darkness have withdrawn;<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Almost within our hand-reach they remain</SPAN><BR>
Who pass beyond the sequence of the dawn.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Not far and strange the Heaven, but very near,<BR>
Your children's hearts unknowingly hold dear.<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">At times we almost catch the door swung wide.</SPAN><BR>
And unforgotten voice almost we hear,<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
I am the heir of Heaven&mdash;and you are just.<BR>
You, you alone I know&mdash;and you I trust.<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">I have sought God beyond his farthest star&mdash;</SPAN><BR>
But here I find Him, in your quickening dust.<BR>
</P>

  MONITION
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
A faint wind, blowing from World's End,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Made strange the city street.</SPAN><BR>
A strange sound mingled in the fall<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Of the familiar feet.</SPAN><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Something unseen whirled with the leaves<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">To tap on door and sill.</SPAN><BR>
Something unknown went whispering by<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Even when the wind was still.</SPAN><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
And men looked up with startled eyes<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">And hurried on their way,</SPAN><BR>
As if they had been called, and told<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">How brief their day.</SPAN><BR>
</P>

  ON THE ROAD
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
Ever just over the top of the next brown rise<BR>
I expect some wonderful thing to flatter my eyes.<BR>
"What's yonder?" I ask of the first wayfarer I meet.<BR>
"Nothing!" he answers, and looks at my travel-worn feet.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
"Only more hills and more hills, like the many you've passed,<BR>
With rough country between, and a poor enough inn at the last."<BR>
But already I am a-move, for I see he is blind,<BR>
And I hate that old grumble I've listened to time out of mind.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
I've tramped it too long not to know there is truth in it still,<BR>
That lure of the turn of the road, of the crest of the hill.<BR>
So I breast me the rise with full hope, well assured I shall see<BR>
Some new prospect of joy, some brave venture a tip-toe for me.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
For I have come far, and confronted the calm and the strife.<BR>
I have fared wide, and bit deep in the apple of life.<BR>
It is sweet at the rind, but oh, sweeter still at the core;<BR>
And whatever be gained, yet the reach of the morrow is more.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
At the crest of the hill I shall hail the new summits to climb.<BR>
The demand of my vision shall beggar the largess of time.<BR>
For I know that the higher I press, the wider I view,<BR>
The more's to be ventured and visioned, in worlds that are new.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
So when my feet, failing, shall stumble in ultimate dark,<BR>
And faint eyes no more the high lift of the pathway shall mark,<BR>
There under the dew I'll lie down with my dreams, for I know<BR>
What bright hill-tops the morning will show me, all red in the glow.<BR>

  HILL TOP SONGS
</H3>

<H4 ALIGN="center">
I<BR>
</H4>

<P CLASS="poem">
Here on the hill<BR>
At last the soul sees clear.<BR>
Desire being still<BR>
The High Unseen appear.<BR>
The thin grass bends<BR>
One way, and hushed attends<BR>
Unknown and gracious ends.<BR>
Where the sheep's pasturing feet<BR>
Have cleft the sods<BR>
The mystic light lies sweet;<BR>
The very clods,<BR>
In purpling hues elate,<BR>
Thrill to their fate;<BR>
The high rock-hollows wait,<BR>
Expecting gods.<BR>
</P>

II<BR>
</H4>

<P CLASS="poem">
When the lights come out in the cottages<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Along the shores at eve,</SPAN><BR>
And across the darkening water<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">The last pale shadows leave;</SPAN><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
And up from the rock-ridged pasture slopes<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">The sheep-bell tinklings steal,</SPAN><BR>
And the folds are shut, and the shepherds<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Turn to their quiet meal;</SPAN><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
And even here, on the unfenced height,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">No journeying wind goes by,</SPAN><BR>
But the earth-sweet smells, and the home-sweet sounds,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Mount, like prayer, to the sky;</SPAN><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Then from the door of my opened heart<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Old blindness and pride are driven,</SPAN><BR>
Till I know how high is the humble,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">The dear earth how close to heaven.</SPAN><BR>

  IN THE VALLEY OF LUCHON
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
Day long, and night long,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">From the soaring peaks and the snow,</SPAN><BR>
Down through the valley villages<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">The cold white waters flow.</SPAN><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Quiet are the villages;<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">And very quiet the cloud</SPAN><BR>
At rest on the breast of the mountain;<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">But the falling waves are loud</SPAN><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Through the little, clustering cottages,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Through the little, climbing fields,</SPAN><BR>
Where every sunburnt vineyard<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Its patch of purple yields.</SPAN><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
High hung, a steel-bright scimitar,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">The crooked glacier gleams.</SPAN><BR>
The white church dreams in the valley<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Where the red oleander dreams.</SPAN><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
And every wonder of beauty<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Comes, as a dream comes, true,</SPAN><BR>
Where the sun drips rose from the ledges<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">And the moon by the peak swims blue.</SPAN><BR>

  THE GOOD EARTH

<P CLASS="poem">
The smell of burning weeds<BR>

The piping of the frogs<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">From meadows wet and bare;</SPAN><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
A presence in the wood,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">And in my blood a stir;</SPAN><BR>
In all the ardent earth<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">No failure or demur.</SPAN><BR>

O spring wind, sweet with love<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">And tender with desire,</SPAN><BR>
Pour into veins of mine<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Your pure, impassioned fire.</SPAN><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
O waters running free<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">With full, exultant song,</SPAN><BR>
Give me, for outworn dream,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Life that is clean and strong.</SPAN><BR>

O good Earth, warm with youth,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">My childhood heart renew.</SPAN><BR>
Make me elate, sincere,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Simple and glad, as you.</SPAN><BR>

Be mindful of thy birth.<BR>

Through long-endured constraint<BR>
Of nights and days,<BR>

In some thick-perfumed and luxurious plot.<BR>

  WHEN THE CLOUD COMES DOWN THE MOUNTAIN

<P CLASS="poem">
When the cloud comes down the mountain,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">And the rain is loud on the leaves,</SPAN><BR>
And the slim flies gather for shelter<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">Under my cabin eaves,&mdash;</SPAN><BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Then my heart goes out to earth,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">With the swollen brook runs free,</SPAN><BR>
Drinks life with the drenched brown roots,<BR>
<SPAN STYLE="margin-left: 1em">And climbs with the sap in the tree.</SPAN><BR>

  THE STREAM

<P CLASS="poem">
I know a stream<BR>
Than which no lovelier flows.<BR>
Its banks a-gleam<BR>
With yarrow and wild rose,<BR>
Singing it goes<BR>
And shining through my dream.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Its waters glide<BR>
Beneath the basking noon,<BR>
A magic tide<BR>
That keeps perpetual June.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
There the light sleeps<BR>
Unstirred by any storm;<BR>
The wild mouse creeps<BR>
Through tall weeds hushed and warm;<BR>
And the shy snipe,<BR>
Alighting unafraid;<BR>
With sudden pipe<BR>
Awakes the dreaming shade.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
So long ago!<BR>
Still, still my memory hears<BR>
Its silver flow<BR>
Across the sundering years,&mdash;<BR>
Its roses glow,<BR>
Ah, through what longing tears!<BR>

Deeps of the wind-torn west,<BR>

'Neath this o'ermastering sky<BR>

Content in the old chains lie,<BR>

Your torn wild scarlets cry?<BR>

Up, Soul, and out<BR>

  GOING OVER

<P CLASS="poem">
A girl's voice in the night troubled my heart.<BR>
Across the roar of the guns, the crash of the shells,<BR>
Low and soft as a sigh, clearly I heard it.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Where was the broken parapet, crumbling about me?<BR>
Where my shadowy comrades, crouching expectant?<BR>
A girl's voice in the dark troubled my heart.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
A dream was the ooze of the trench, the wet clay slipping,<BR>
A dream the sudden out-flare of the wide-flung Verys.<BR>
I saw but a garden of lilacs, a-flower in the dusk.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
What was the sergeant saying?&mdash;I passed it along.&mdash;<BR>
Did <I>I</I> pass it along? I was breathing the breath of the lilacs.<BR>
For a girl's voice in the night troubled my heart.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
Over!  How the mud sucks!  Vomits red the barrage.<BR>
But I am far off in the hush of a garden of lilacs.<BR>
For a girl's voice in the night troubled my heart.<BR>
Tender and soft as a sigh, clearly I heard it.<BR>

  CAMBRAI AND MARNE
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
Before our trenches at Cambrai<BR>
We saw their columns cringe away.<BR>
We saw their masses melt and reel<BR>
Before our line of leaping steel.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
A handful to their storming hordes<BR>
We scourged them with the scourge of swords,<BR>
And still, the more we slew, the more<BR>
Came up for every slain a score.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Between the hedges and the town<BR>
Their cursing squadrons we rode down.<BR>
To stay them we outpoured our blood<BR>
Between the beetfields and the wood.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
In that red hell of shrieking shell<BR>
Unfaltering our gunners fell.<BR>
They fell, or ere that day was done,<BR>
Beside the last unshattered gun.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
But still we held them, like a wall<BR>
On which the breakers vainly fall&mdash;<BR>
Till came the word, and we obeyed,<BR>
Reluctant, bleeding, undismayed.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Our feet, astonished, learned retreat,<BR>
Our souls rejected still defeat.<BR>
Unbroken still, a lion at bay,<BR>
We drew back grimly from Cambrai.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
In blood and sweat, with slaughter spent,<BR>
They thought us beaten as we went;<BR>
Till suddenly we turned and smote<BR>
The shout of triumph in their throat.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
At last, at last we turned and stood&mdash;<BR>
And Marne's fair water ran with blood.<BR>
We stood by trench and steel and gun,<BR>
For now the indignant flight was done.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
We ploughed their shaken ranks with fire.<BR>
We trod their masses into mire.<BR>
Our sabres drove through their retreat,<BR>
As drives the whirlwind through young wheat.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
At last, at last we flung them back<BR>
Along their drenched and smoking track.<BR>
We hurled them back, in blood and flame,<BR>
The reeking ways by which they came.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
By cumbered road and desperate ford,<BR>
How fled their shamed and harassed horde!<BR>
Shout, Sons of Freemen, for the day<BR>
When Marne so well avenged Cambrai!<BR>
